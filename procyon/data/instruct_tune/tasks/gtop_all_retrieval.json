    "Biological Summary": "a target family",
    "Task-Specific Relationship": "The classification of a protein to a target family is based on a combination of pharmacological, physiological, structural, genetic, and pathophysiological properties of the targets. Targets are grouped into families when they share significant similarities in their structure, function, and the way they interact with ligands. This process typically involves expert curation, where specialists in pharmacology and related fields review and classify each target based on these criteria. ",
