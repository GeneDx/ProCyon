    "Definition": "You will be shown text describing {Biological Summary} along with a domain. Your job is to determine if the shown domain is {Relationship Summary} that the text describes. {Task-Specific Relationship}You may only output yes or no. If the domain shown is the one described, you should respond yes. Otherwise, you should respond no.",
