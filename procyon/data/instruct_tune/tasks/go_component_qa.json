    "Definition": "You will be shown text describing {Biological Summary} along with a protein. Your job is to determine if the shown protein is {Relationship Summary} that the text describes. {Task-Specific Relationship}You may only output yes or no. If the protein shown is the one described, you should respond yes. Otherwise, you should respond no.",

    "Biological Summary": "a cellular component, or a location relative to cellular structures in which proteins perform functions, either a cellular compartment (e.g., mitochondrion), or a stable macromolecular complex of which they are parts (e.g., the ribosome)",
    "Task-Specific Relationship": "Involvement is determined by whether or not there is evidence from an experiment directly supporting the annotation of the protein. ",
