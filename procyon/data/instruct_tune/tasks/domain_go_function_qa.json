    "Definition": "You will be shown text describing {Biological Summary} along with a domain. Your job is to determine if the shown domain is {Relationship Summary} that the text describes. {Task-Specific Relationship}You may only output yes or no. If the domain shown is the one described, you should respond yes. Otherwise, you should respond no.",

    "Relationship Summary": "involved in the function",
    "Biological Summary": "a molecular function, or a molecular activity that occur at the molecular level, such as 'catalysis' or 'transport', performed by proteins",
    "Task-Specific Relationship": "When a domain family appears in a set of functionally similar proteins, the conserved function described at the most specific level to be relevant to all proteins in that family are associated with the domain family, and thus all domains belonging to the family.
