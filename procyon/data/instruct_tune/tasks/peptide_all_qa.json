    "Relationship Summary": "the two entities interact based on the sequences provided. Note that some peptides may be large enough to constitute a protein",
    "Biological Summary": "",
    "Task-Specific Relationship": "Consider the following criteria when making your determination:\n1. Electrostatic Interactions: Look for complementary charges between the protein and peptide sequences.\n2. Hydrophobic Interactions: Identify regions where nonpolar amino acids might promote interaction through hydrophobic effects.\n3. Hydrogen Bonding: Check for potential hydrogen bonds between donor and acceptor groups in the sequences.\n4. Van der Waals Forces: Consider how the spatial proximity of atoms might contribute to weak, non-covalent interactions.\n5. Amino Acid Sequence: Assess the overall compatibility of the sequences for interaction potential. ",
