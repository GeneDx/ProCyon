    "Definition": "You will be shown text describing {Relationship Summary} along with a protein. Your job is to determine if the shown protein is {Biological Summary} that the text describes. {Task-Specific Relationship}. You may only output Yes or No. If the protein shown is the one described, you should respond Yes. Otherwise, you should respond No.",
    "Relationship Summary": "a pathway or biological function where proteins are involved",
    "Biological Summary": "involved in the function",
    "Task-Specific Relationship": "Involvement is determined by whether or not there is evidence from an experiment directly supporting the annotation of the protein",
